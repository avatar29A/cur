@defmodule[cur #:lang]

The language @racketmodname[cur] is a dependently-typed language that arbitrary Racket meta-programs
can manipulate.
The core language of @racketmodname[cur] is essentially TT@todo{citation
e.g. https://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/thesis.pdf chapter 2}.
The trusted core provides nothing beyond this language.
However, untrusted user-land code provides, via Racket meta-programming, features such as modules, top-level
definitions, multi-arity functions, implicit partial application, syntax notations, a tactic DSL,
interactive tactics, and a programming language meta-theory DSL.
These features run at compile time and generate @tech{curnel forms}, forms in the core language,
which are type-checked before they are run.

Arbitrary @racketmodname[racket] code can run at @gtech{phases} higher than 0, but
@racketmodname[racket] code at @gtech{phase} 0 is unsupported and should result in a syntax error.
The language @racketmodname[cur] exports everything in @racketmodname[racket],
@racketmodname[racket/syntax], and @racketmodname[syntax/parse] at @gtech{phase} 1.

The language @racketmodname[cur] provides reflection features to equip users with the tools necessary
to write advanced meta-programs.
These features in includes compile-time functions for type-checking, performing na√Øve type inference,
deciding equivalence between @racketmodname[cur] terms, expanding macros in @racketmodname[cur] forms,
and evaluating @racketmodname[cur] forms at compile-time.
Programmers can use these reflection feature with little fear, as the resulting @tech{curnel forms}
will always be type-checked prior to running.
